    <!-- ===== OVERVIEW ===== -->
    <section class="project-section fade-in">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        After months of working with UDB (Ultimate Doom Builder) and creating smaller mods, I decided to challenge myself and aim higher. I wanted to build something unique. Α fusion of Resident Evil's iconic survival horror atmosphere with Doom's fast-paced gameplay. The result is a mod that gives the classic 1993 Doom a fresh and modern twist. Players once again explore the Raccoon City Police Station, searching for keys, solving environmental puzzles, fighting enemies, and slowly uncovering the mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        After release, the mod reached over 250 players, a number I'm genuinely proud of and honestly never expected. Seeing something I built get this attention has been one of the most rewarding parts of the project.
      </p>
      <p><strong>• Playtime: 25–30 minutes</strong></p>
      <p><strong>• Development Time: 8 weeks</strong></p>

    <!-- ===== WORKFLOW ===== -->
    <section class="project-section fade-in">
      <h2>Workflow</h2>

      <ul class="takeaways-list">
        <li>I started by collecting references from the original Raccoon City Police Station to capture its authentic layout and atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Once I had a solid visual foundation, I moved to GZDoom and began blocking out the main areas of the map.</li>
        <li>After establishing the complete structure, I started placing gameplay elements specifically the key items required for the player to progress through the map.</li>
        <li>Next, I placed enemies in strategic positions to create challenging and varied combat encounters.</li>
        <li>Finally, after several playtesting sessions I carefully adjusted and placed ammo, health packs, and other resources to balance the overall experience and pacing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- ===== PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED ===== -->
    <section class="project-section fade-in">
      <h2>Problems encountered and how i solved them</h2>

      <ul class="takeaways-list">
        <li>One of the primary challenges I faced was GZDoom's 2.5D architecture, which prevents direct stacking of sectors for multi-story floors due to rendering glitches. My solution was to create a separate sector for the upper floor and use a teleporter to seamlessly transport the player there, effectively resolving multi-level navigation. That solved the problem of having floors and created a sense of verticality that proved vital for the player experience. This taught me a lot about engine limitations and how to think creatively to overcome them.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- ===== PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ===== -->
    <section class="project-section fade-in">
      <h2>Personal Experience and Challenges</h2>

      <ul class="takeaways-list">
        <li>This project was an extremely valuable experience for me. I set a clear deadline of 8 weeks and committed to it, which forced me to plan carefully and stay highly motivated throughout the entire development process.</li>
        <li>The strict timeline kept me constantly engaged and pushed me to improve the project every day. During development I was continuously researching new techniques, iterating on my designs, and learning game design and level design practices along the way.</li>
        <li>The greatest design challenge was maintaining consistent flow and pacing. I wanted to keep surprising the player with new elements, mechanics, and moments of tension throughout the entire experience. Playtesting and external feedback would have been extremely helpful, but since I was working solo, I had to rely entirely on self-experimentation and repeated self-playtesting to refine the balance and feel.</li>
