    <!-- ===== OVERVIEW ===== -->
    <section class="project-section fade-in">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Project Trash is a 3D arcade-style game developed in Unity during a 3-week school project.<p>
       <p> What's special : <p>
       <li> One-hand control with clumsy and quirky physics 
        <li>Sort trash correctly into recycle bins by throwing 
       <li> 6 types of items: glass, metal, paper, plastic, hazardous and general waste 
       <li> Constant flow of trash, increasing over time 
        <li>Timed combo multiplier for consecutive correct sorts and to keep the fast pace 
       <li> 10 mistakes and you’re fired... Game Over
      </p>

      <p>
        The main focus of the project was to create a polished gameplay experience within a short development cycle,
        emphasizing iteration, clarity, and responsiveness.

    <!-- ===== MY ROLE ===== -->
    <section class="project-section fade-in">
      <h2>My Role</h2>

      <p>
        In this project, I was a Game Designer and primarily responsible for:
      </p>

      <ul class="takeaways-list">
        <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Implemented the core game mechanics and allowed the team to gain an early understanding of the game's overall look and feel.</li>
        <li><strong>VFX:</strong> I was responsible  for the VFX of the game as well as various feedback elements such as light indicators.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> I was tasked to make the level feel alive by adding lighting and post process effects.</li>

        <li><strong>Level Layout:</strong> I helped shape the structure and layout of the facility using basic shapes and Unity's ProBuilder tool.</li>
             </ul>

    <!-- ===== CONCLUSION ===== -->
    <section class="project-section fade-in">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        What really stood out to me was the importance of communication.
This was my first experience working with other people on a game, and it gave me valuable insight into the skills and mindset needed in a real professional work environment.
Giving and receiving feedback from teammates and mentors played a critical role in my growth — both as a game designer and as a collaborative team member.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, it helped my get out of my comfort zone and take iniative on speaking up and sharing my opinion with other team members.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, Project Trash was a valuable experience in understanding production timelines,deadlines
        and collaboration.
