<!-- ===== SUMMARY ===== -->
<section class="project-section fade-in">
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Inspired by Firewatch, you are tasked with keeping the area safe from fires and any other dangers that might arise. What begins as an afternoon adventure soon takes a wrong turn…
  </p>
  <p>
    The core design goal of this level was to shape a clear emotional progression through spatial design.
    The player begins in a position of safety and clarity, gradually transitioning into uncertainty, tension and isolation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than relying only on narrative exposition, I focused on how verticality, visibility, environmental contrast and pacing could influence the player’s emotional state throughout the experience.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ===== NARRATIVE CONTEXT ===== -->
<section class="project-section fade-in">
  <h2>Narrative Context</h2>
  <p>
    In pre-production I always start by asking questions to define the level characteristics.

  <h2>References and Inspirations</h2>
  <ul class="takeaways-list">
    <li><strong>My main inspiration came from my home country Greece and its vastly unexplored environments.</strong> I wanted to showcase real life locations to achieve realism.</li>

  <h2>Mechanics / Design Goals</h2>

  <h3>Mechanics:</h3>
  <ul class="takeaways-list">
    <li>Jump</li>
    <li>Crouch</li>
    <li>Interact</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Design Goals:</h3>
  <ul class="takeaways-list">
    <li><strong>Emotional Pacing:</strong> Calm → Curiosity → Tension → Isolation.</li>
    <li><strong>Narrative-Driven Guidance:</strong> The radio reinforces safety early and creates isolation when removed.</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Contrast:</strong> Open vistas create comfort, narrow passages create vulnerability.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- ===== LEVEL WALKTHROUGH ===== -->
<section class="project-section fade-in">
  <h2>Level Walkthrough</h2>

  <h3>Beat 1 (Start – Safety & Clarity)</h3>
  <ul class="takeaways-list walkthrough-sequence">
    <li>The player is informed through the radio to go look for a potential fire. <strong>(Objective/Goal Started)</strong></li>
    <li>He is in the watchtower and can see the whole playable area. <strong>(Vista)</strong></li>
    <li>Through the narrative guidance from the radio, he chooses the shortcut to reach his goal. <strong>(Player Guidance)</strong></li>
    <li>The voice foreshadows the jump, so the player is prepared to take it <strong>(Teach Mechanic/Tutorial)</strong>. Also, not punishing the experience if the player fails the jump. He can try again. <strong>(Safety Net)</strong></li>
    <li>After the jump he can't backtrack, meaning the player must push forward. <strong>(One-way valve)</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="beat-heading">Beat 2 (Middle – Curiosity & Rising Tension)</h3>
  <ul class="takeaways-list walkthrough-sequence">
    <li>The player now sees the objective visually (smoke) and progresses to the gameplay section inside the Forest. <strong>(Sees smoke, tension rising)</strong></li>
    <li>He sees a locked gate and must find the key. He is informed that the key can be found at the old canoe rental building. <strong>(Player Engagement)</strong></li>
    <li>He now sees the building and with visual indication (light flicker) he is drawn there to investigate. <strong>(Attract the player's attention / Frame the area)</strong></li>
    <li>He finds out that the building has been breached so someone is at the area. <strong>(Player Engagement)</strong></li>
    <li>To progress, he must climb to the roof and enter the open hatch that leads to the key. <strong>(The framing that was used before was to showcase the trashcans meaning they can be used for traversal. (Affordances))</strong></li>
    <li>The player reaches the gate area and now can open it. <strong>(Backtrack)</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="beat-heading">Beat 3 (End – Isolation & Unease)</h3>
  <ul class="takeaways-list walkthrough-sequence">
    <li>The gate is now opened, and the player sees the canoe storage area. Props are scattered everywhere. <strong>(Player Engagement - Tension)</strong></li>
    <li>The voice from the radio suddenly stops responding. <strong>(Player Engagement – Tension/Isolation)</strong></li>
    <li>The player sees a backpack scattered on the floor implying that someone was being chased. <strong>(Player Engagement – Tension)</strong></li>
    <li>He progresses through a tiny opening by crouching. <strong>(Contrast the emotional state of the player / Teach Mechanic. He feels someone is there and now must crawl through a tiny space)</strong></li>
    <li>He progresses through a more open forest and sees a camp site. He then discovers blood, guns and other things. He hears a gunshot. <strong>(Player Engagement)</strong></li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ===== FINAL THOUGHTS ===== -->
<section class="project-section fade-in">
  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <ul class="takeaways-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Play with verticality.</strong> The player starts at a high elevation and gradually descends. This is to showcase the emotional state of the avatar and the dark turn that the story takes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Trees and logs help structure leading lines. Also mushrooms work for the dialogue Triggers. After the player crawls through the tiny space, he can see mushrooms upside down meaning that communication has been lost.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    Overall, this project taught me the importance of iteration, real-world inspiration, and subtle environmental storytelling to enhance emotional impact.
